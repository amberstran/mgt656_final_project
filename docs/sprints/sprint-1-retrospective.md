# Sprint 1 — Retrospective


## Overview

Sprint 1 centered on understanding user needs, defining the product vision, validating the problem space, and establishing technical readiness.
This retrospective reflects on what went well, what could have gone better, and how the team will improve in Sprint 2.

## What Went Well

### 1. Strong Alignment on Product Vision

The team achieved clear consensus on the purpose of Agora and the user problems it aims to solve.
This alignment made downstream design work highly efficient.

### 2. Thorough User Research

Personas and journey maps were well-developed and grounded in qualitative insights.
These artifacts provided a strong foundation for defining MVP features.

### 3. High-Quality Wireframes

All major user flows were designed, reviewed, and validated.
Wireframes helped the team visualize the entire user experience end-to-end.

### 4. Complete and Organized Backlog

Twenty user stories with acceptance criteria were fully created and structured in GitHub Projects.
The backlog’s 99 story points provide a realistic foundation for planning future sprints.

## What Didn’t Go Well

### 1. Scope Adjustments Needed

As the team refined user needs, several feature assumptions had to be re-scoped or clarified (e.g., anonymity model, circle behaviors).
This required revisiting earlier decisions and adjusting the MVP definition.

### 2. Limited Time for Technical Experimentation

Although architecture planning was completed, the team had less time than expected to prototype certain components.
These tasks will require deeper exploration in Sprint 2.

---

## What We Should Improve

### 1. Earlier Technical Prototyping

Validating system constraints earlier will help prevent rework in future sprints.
Sprint 2 will include technical spikes for key components before full implementation.

### 2. More Granular Task Breakdown

Some user stories may still be too large for efficient development.
Next sprint, the team will break stories into smaller, more actionable tasks.

### 3. Improve Team Communication Cadence

Increasing touchpoints (e.g., short async updates) will help maintain alignment as implementation begins.

---

## Action Items for Sprint 2

1. Break large MVP stories into smaller development tasks.
2. Conduct technical spikes for CAS authentication, image upload, and database schema validation.
3. Finalize API structure and begin initial endpoint implementations.
4. Establish team conventions for code style, reviews, and testing.
5. Prepare for the first functional prototype (basic posting + feed display).

## Reflection Across Sprint 1

Looking back across this sprint, the team successfully built a strong foundation for the Agora platform.
We gained clarity on our users, validated the problem space, aligned on the MVP vision, and created a structured backlog to guide implementation.
The lessons learned will directly shape our workflow, collaboration, and development efficiency going forward.
